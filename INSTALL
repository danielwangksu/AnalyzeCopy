==== ANALYZECOPY WITH THE FINDER ====

 1. Open a new Finder window 
 2. Go to the AnalyzeCopySource volume
 3. Change dir to "group0"

 4. Open another Finder window
 5. Go to the AnalyzeCopyDest volume
 6. Change dir to "40_finder"
 7. Change dir to "result"

 8. Drag n drop all files in the source dir to the target dir.
    Finder will ask you for your password

 9. Run:  rake vh
    This will rebuild the index.html file that shows the comparison result.


==== ANALYZECOPY WITH muCommander ====

 1. In left pane, change dir to: /Volumes/AnalyzeCopySource/group0/
 2. In right pane, change dir to: /Volumes/AnalyzeCopyDest/41_mucommander/result/

    muCommander hangs with some of the dirs, so when you see it's hanging
    then just cancel the copy, deselect the file, and copy the remaining items.

    This will rebuild the index.html file that shows the comparison result.
