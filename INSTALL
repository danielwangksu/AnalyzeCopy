AnalyzeCopy - black box validation suite for copying files


==== PREREQUISITES ====

 1. Mac OS X 10.7.x

 2. Ruby 1.9.3 or better  (ruby --version)
    An old version of Ruby comes with OS X which cannot be used.
	I recommend installing ruby using RVM
    http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/

 3. Rake 0.9.2 or better  (rake --version)
    Is usually installed together with Ruby 1.9.3.
	If not you have to install it manually.

 4. Python, any version will do

 5. Perl, any version will do



==== INSTALLATION ====

STEP#1
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install File::Copy::Recursive'

STEP#2
install "osxutils 1.7"
http://osxutils.sourceforge.net/

STEP#3
Compile AnalyzeCopy:
prompt> cd utils
prompt> pwd
/Users/johndoe/code/AnalyzeCopy/utils
prompt> rake
prompt>



AnalyzeCopy is now ready to be used.



==== USING ANALYZECOPY ====

prompt> pwd
/Users/johndoe/code/AnalyzeCopy
prompt> rake
prompt>

You will be prompted for "sudo" password, since some
of the tests requires root.


==== ANALYZECOPY WITH THE FINDER ====

 1. Open a new Finder window 
 2. Go to the AnalyzeCopySource volume
 3. Change dir to "group0"

 4. Open another Finder window
 5. Go to the AnalyzeCopyDest volume
 6. Change dir to "40_finder"
 7. Change dir to "result"

 8. Drag n drop all files in the source dir to the target dir.
    Finder will ask you for your password

 9. Run:  rake vh
    This will rebuild the index.html file that shows the comparison result.


==== ANALYZECOPY WITH muCommander ====

 1. In left pane, change dir to: /Volumes/AnalyzeCopySource/group0/
 2. In right pane, change dir to: /Volumes/AnalyzeCopyDest/41_mucommander/result/
 3. In left pane select all files

 4. Hit F5 to copy, choose overwrite file.
    muCommander hangs with some of the dirs, so when you see it's hanging
    then just cancel the copy, deselect the file, and copy the remaining items.

 5. Run:  rake vh
    This will rebuild the index.html file that shows the comparison result.
